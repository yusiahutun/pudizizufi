For five years — starting mere days after his last record came out — fans have latched onto social-media moves, festival bookings, business shake-ups, and promises from the shifty folks at Lamar’s label Top Dawg Entertainment as signs of a new project to come. And who could blame them, after DAMN. cemented Lamar among hip-hop’s greats, earning the rapper <a href=#>the first Pulitzer Prize for non-classical or -jazz music</a>?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl30jrmug000x3h6hsf21eklp@published data-word-count=145>Last month, Lamar finally put that speculation to rest. In a press release on his website oklama.com, he <a href=#>announced his fifth album, Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers</a>, would be out May 13. (To be clear, it’s far from the first time we’ve gotten any new Kung Fu Kenny since 2017, with <a href=#>Lamar spearheading the Black Panther soundtrack in 2018</a> and recording an array of features in the meantime.) He’s been spare on more details, <a href=#>teasing</a> that Mr. Morale could possibly be a double album before giving us a taste of his new sound with <a href=#>the surprise release</a> of single “The Heart Pt. 5” and its deep-faked video on May 8. In just a few more days, fans will finally get what they’ve been waiting for. Until then, here’s a look back at the last five years of thinking new Kendrick was on the horizon.</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl30jrn25000z3h6hx45avfpt@published data-word-count=97><strong>April 20, 2017: When he said he had more after DAMN.</strong><br>Lamar himself first put fans on watch just days after releasing DAMN., admitting <a href=#>on an Instagram Live</a> that he had “more music.” That revelation came days after some hungry listeners <a href=#>theorized</a> that Lamar would drop a whole second album for Easter. But a day after teasing that new music, Lamar walked back what he said. “None is coming,” he <a href=#>tweeted</a>. He also thanked fans for “always anticipating new music of my own” — though he surely meant “obsessing over my every move in hopes of new music.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl30jrn6e00123h6h602yk33g@published data-word-count=13><strong>August 29, 2018: When Top Dawg promised four more new albums in 2018</strong></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>i have 2 more for y'all now...

With four months left in 2018, CEO Anthony “Top Dawg” Tiffith <a href=#>tweeted</a> that he had at least two more albums coming that year, but was “trying for 4.” Of course, some thought new Kendrick could’ve been in the mix. Instead, the label didn’t even make two releases, only dropping a reissue of Reason’s mixtape There You Have It.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl30jrndl00153h6ho77xhovo@published data-word-count=111><strong>August 31, 2018: When Isaiah Rashad said he heard a “damn near” full Lamar album</strong><br>TDE is a tight crew, so if anyone was going to know about new Kendrick, it would be the other TDE musicians … right? Wrong. One of the first people to claim Lamar’s new album was on the way was his labelmate Isaiah Rashad, who’d collaborated with Lamar on his 2016 song “Wat’s Wrong.” <a href=#>On an Instagram Live</a> with Top Dawg, Rashad said he’d recently heard a “damn near” full new album from Lamar.
