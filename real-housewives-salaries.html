From Bethenny Frankel to Lisa Vanderpump to Nene Leakes, the Real Housewives of Bravo’s 10 cities are known to make millions per year for their on-air feuds and memorable one-liners. But that wasn’t always the case.</p><p>The <a href=# rel=noopener>Real Housewives</a> franchise started back in 2006 with the premiere of <a href=# id=auto-tag_the-real-housewives-of-orange-county data-tag=the-real-housewives-of-orange-county>The Real Housewives of Orange County</a>. The original series—which starred OG of the OC Vicki Gunvalson and four other Housewives—led to the creation of Housewives shows in nine other cities across the United States: New York City, Atlanta, New Jersey, D.C., Beverly Hills, Miami, <a href=# rel=noopener>Potomac</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>Dallas</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Salt Lake City</a>. RHODC and <i>RHOD </i>have since been cancelled, but the rest of the Housewives universe seems to still be thriving, especially the newest Housewives city, RHOSLC, which premiered in November 2020.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>With more than 15 years on air, it’s understandable why Bravo fans are so curious about <a href=# rel=noopener>Real Housewives’ salaries</a> and who makes the most. While we don’t know the salaries of all the Real Housewives (there have been more than 100!), the paychecks of many fan-favorite reality stars have been revealed over the years. Without further ado, here are all the <a href=# rel=noopener>Real Housewives salaries</a> we could find.</p><h2 class=p1><span class=s1>Vicki Gunvalson (Season 1 – 13)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/The-Real-Housewives-of-Orange-County-Vicki-Gunvalson.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>Salary: $750,000 per season</span></p><p>Vicki—the OG of the OC—credits herself as the Housewife who started it all. She starred on the RHOC as a main cast member from seasons 1 to 13. She returned as a “friend” for season 14 before she was fired from the franchise altogether. She holds the record for the Housewife who has been on the most seasons next to RHONY‘s Ramona Singer. According to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Radar Online</a>, Vicki made $750,000 per season in her final few seasons as a main cast member.</p><h2 class=p1><span class=s1>Tamra Judge (Season 1 – 14)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/The-Real-Housewives-of-Orange-County-Tamra-Judge.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>Salary: $900,000 per season</span></p><p>Tamra made her RHOC debut on season 3 in 2007. She went on to star on the show for 12 more seasons before she was fired after season 14. <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Radar Online</a> reported in 2020 that Tamra was offered $60,000 to film three episodes for season 15 at a rate of $20,000 per episode, which she turned down. The site also reported that Tamra made $900,000 per season at the time of her exit, which is why she rejected the deal. Tamra later denied the numbers on her Instagram, though she didn’t reveal her real salary. “Not true. You need to add another zero to that number,” she wrote.</p><h2 class=p1><span class=s1>Shannon Beador (Season 9 – Present)</span></h2><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/The-Real-Housewives-of-Orange-County-Shannon-Beador.jpg></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Salary:&nbsp;$583,338 per season</span></p><p>Shannon joined RHOC in season 9 and is one of the current cast members on the show.

(David claimed that Shannon mad $800,000 from the show, while Shannon asserted that she made only $400,000.) The documents also reveal that Shannon made only $31,500 on season 12 of RHOC before her massive raise for season 13.

After season 3 of RHOBH, Lisa launched her own Bravo spinoff, Vanderpump Rules, which became a massive success for the network. According to a 2014 report by <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Radar Online</a>, Lisa made $500,000 per season as a cast member on RHOBH.

She starred on the show for 3 seasons until she was fired during the season 3 RHOBH reunion. At the reunion, Andy Cohen announced that Adrienne would not return to show after she failed to show up at the reunion. Adrienne’s firing also came after she made Bravo remove scenes where Brandi Glanville claimed that Adrienne’s children were born via surrogate. Adrienne went on to confirm the surrogate story in an interview with People, which didn’t seem to bode well with Bravo. As for what she made, Adrienne made $200,000 per season, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Editor Choice</a>, which is nothing compared to her reported $350 million net worth.
