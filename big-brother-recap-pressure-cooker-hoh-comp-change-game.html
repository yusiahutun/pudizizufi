If it's so iconic, why wait so long that some of these Houseguests were toddlers when Kaysar Ridha made the worst deal of his life?</p><p>Nevertheless, it came back, and in even more grueling fashion. Rather than being played outside, this one happened inside and mostly in the dark, making it far more disorienting. It also happened after a fully day on Thursday, right after the live broadcast.</p><p>This was endurance and will above all. Well, those and focus. As the hours tick by, one slight twitch can knock your hand off your button and then it's all over. And the competition was that simple. Press a button and hold it as long as you can.</p><p>It was also a long night for outgoing Head of Household Felicia, who was not eligible to play. But at least she had something to watch on the television, even if there was no sound.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:1254420e-b249-46d5-bebb-88929aa67f06 data-container-ref=toofab:article:aca3fa9c-4a82-4595-91fb-4b66f6bcc868 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/c5/5by4/2023/08/25/c559cb4d2337400d8f23680ff434dba5_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty / Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Ariana Madix Explains Why She Still Lives with Ex Tom Sandoval After Breakup & Cheating Scandal</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h3 class=h3>Pressure Cooker Reveals</h3><p>As with all competitions that go long enough, there are things to be learned as the time passes and people start talking, and dropping. For one thing, we got a sense of who's still trying their hardest to play the middle.</p><p>In this case, Matt admitted to quitting on purpose because he's not ready to show his cards as a competition threat. Cory, who's basically forfeited every comp this season, wasn't nearly as subtle when he dropped out later, reaching right up to adjust his hat wit his button hand. Luckily, everyone seemed to bleary to read too much into it.</p><p>For the most part, though, people went due to silly mistakes. The biggest problem for the dominant power alliance in the house is that the first three of those were Jared, Cirie, and Izzy. None of them threw it, but it is remarkable that all three of them went out — with mother-and-son not even making it to the two-hour mark.</p><p>Luckily for the show, the overall competition dragged on and on, quickly closing in on the nearly 14-hour run of the original Pressure Cooker. In fact, with no one in the room having any idea how long they'd been there, this one was just four minutes shy of that record (13hours, 49 minutes to 13 hours, 53 minutes).</p><p>The contestants also got prizes (or punishments) in the order of their elimination.

Some see the strategic threat she is, but we suspect they think they can just deal with her later and worry about bigger threats in the meantime. That's where she excels, though, flying so brazenly under the radar while pulling strings. And yep, they're letting her do it. <strong>[Grade: B+]</strong></p><p><strong>Felicia Cannon</strong> (63, real estate agent) was one of the best things that could have happened for Cirie in this game, giving her a staunch ally she could relate to and someone who is in a similar situation, as an older woman in the house. They've become quite the savvy duo, navigating a complicated game from the background (though not as hidden as they'd probably like). <strong>[Grade: B]</strong></p><p><strong>America Lopez</strong> (27, medical receptionist) made a deal for herself and for Cory that should keep her safe and invisible this week. She has proven herself a strong competitor, but has yet to be tested on that front, so not that many people are looking at her. The biggest detriment ot her game is she seems to be flying mostly solo in the house, despite being part of the Legend 25 alliance. <strong>[Grade: C+]</strong></p><p><strong>Mecole Hayes</strong> (30, political consultant) almost had this one. Like America, she's proving herself a real competitor, while also keeping her real game very close to her chest. She's so stoic, it's hard to know what alliances might even be real for her, and she doesn't get much in confessionals to make it clear. But she's in a safe spot for now. <strong>[Grade: C+]</strong></p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:bf289047-9a9d-4ec5-91e9-89844af1bb18 data-container-ref=toofab:article:aca3fa9c-4a82-4595-91fb-4b66f6bcc868 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/1a/5by4/2023/08/25/1afeb3436fd14521892b25ec61f8438c_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Teen Mom's Catelynn and Tyler Baltierra Talk OnlyFans Success: 'She's Pimping Me Out!' (Exclusive)</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>Cameron Hardin</strong> (34, stay-at-home dad) rises to power this week, but remains a huge threat beyond this week. He's targeting his former alliance members, putting faith in the Legend 25 alliance that was faked around him. That makes him almost a pawn this week, if he doesn't go rogue and target Izzy, and a potential target next week. He needs to work hard to transform fake into real, or find some new friends. <strong>[Grade: C+]</strong></p><p><strong>Matthew Klotz</strong> (27, deaflympics gold medalist) seems to be building a real bond with the power trio of the house (Cirie, Felicia, Izzy), which could really impact the game moving forward. He's so much of a wild card since Reilly's eviction, as he had really only gravitated to her in a meaningful way. He could really make a difference as the game progresses ... we'll have to wait and see. <strong>[Grade: C+]</strong></p><p><strong>Cory Wurtenberger</strong> (21, college student) continues to fly as under the radar as he can as a non-threat early in the game. But there are a lot of people with him already on their mind for the next phase of the game, when the middle of the pack starts standing out with all the early flameouts leaving them exposed. At that point, he'll have to start showing up, so we can see what he's really made of. <strong>[Grade: C]</strong></p><p><strong>Red Utley</strong> (37, sales) rises dramatically this week thanks to the fact Cameron took power, and his own skills of observation. The only detriment to his game is that he doesn't really have the numbers. But he's seeing the game, and doing a great job of reading people. He needs to turn that into a stronger social presence to really solidify something around himself, though. <strong>[Grade: C]</strong></p><p><strong>Bowie Jane Ball</strong> (45, barrister/DJ) is like a balloon. <strong>[Grade: C]</strong></p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:22f1652c-7740-448d-b3aa-baa16632229b data-container-ref=toofab:article:aca3fa9c-4a82-4595-91fb-4b66f6bcc868 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/18/5by4/2023/08/25/18e939060d3b425b800b307c1b29e499_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Ariana Madix Blasts Bethenny Frankel's 'Hurtful' Interview with Rachel Leviss</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>Jared Fields</strong> (25, exterminator) is scaring us because he is really getting too close to Blue, and that's when young men start to get stupid. We've seen people throw their game away to save a showmance, and we could definitely see him doing it. Only in his case, it could destroy more than just his game. Can Cirie keep her boy in line? He's been showing a stubborn streak of late with her, sullen and pouty, so we're not so sure. <strong>[Grade: C]</strong></p><p><strong>Izzy Gleicher</strong> (32, professional flutist) has to really, really learn to work her face. She telegraphs every thought in her head with her expressions, and people are starting to pay attention. The good news for Mama Cirie and Jared is that we actually kind of believe she would keep their secret out of love and respect if she were to find herself heading out the door. We weren't sure of that a couple weeks ago. But for her own sake, she needs to calm the f- down.<strong> [Grade: C-]</strong></p><p><strong>Blue Kim</strong> (25, brand strategist) finds herself on the Block and not necessarily the target right now. But, she's also a potential liability for the power trio, as she's distracting Jared. Could Cirie decide to sever her son's showmance, she's got the influential powers to maybe make that happen ... even if Cameron isn't on board. Blue's fate may be less in her hands this week than she realizes.. <strong>[Grade: D+]</strong></p><p><strong>Jag Bains</strong> (25, truck company owner) is a likable guy who's proven he can hold his own in competitions. That seems to be the main criteria for Cameron, who's moving with the house to eliminate perceived competition threats. The last two evicted HGs had wins under their belts, and now Jag has one Coincidence? <strong>[Grade: D]</strong></p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:8324cd0d-4151-4e1b-ab21-2a32f4b39af2 data-container-ref=toofab:article:aca3fa9c-4a82-4595-91fb-4b66f6bcc868 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/7a/5by4/2023/08/24/7a64afa45e6643c88ec08843c17182e9_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Hugh Hefner's Son Marston Calls Out Family's 'Double Standard' After Joining OnlyFans</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h3 class=h3>House Chatter</h3><ul><li>"The game has absolutely reset.
